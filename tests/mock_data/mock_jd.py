                    Job Title: Machine Learning Engineer – AI Systems
                    Location: Bengaluru, India
                    Experience: 2–4 years
                    Type: Full-time

                    We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join our AI and Data team. You will be responsible for building and deploying scalable ML pipelines and models for real-world applications including NLP and computer vision.

                    Responsibilities:
                    - Design and develop machine learning models for text classification, recommendation systems, and document processing.
                    - Fine-tune transformer-based models like BERT, GPT, or Gemma for domain-specific tasks.
                    - Implement data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization.
                    - Deploy models using FastAPI or similar frameworks as microservices.
                    - Collaborate with data scientists and software engineers in cross-functional teams.
                    - Monitor and retrain models based on feedback and performance metrics.

                    Requirements:
                    - Strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning.
                    - Proficiency in Python and libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
                    - Experience with Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, or similar GenAI tools.
                    - Knowledge of vector stores like FAISS or Chroma for semantic search.
                    - Ability to build APIs using FastAPI or Flask.
                    - Experience with Docker and version control tools like Git.

                    Nice to Have:
                    - Familiarity with MLOps tools such as MLflow or Airflow.
                    - Experience deploying ML models to cloud platforms like AWS or GCP.
                    - Background in working on chatbots, summarization tools, or resume screeners.

                    Benefits:
                    - Work on exciting and real-world AI projects.
                    - Continuous learning and training support.
                    - Flexible work environment.
